# Solution Architecture
This section covers the Solution Architecture for the lifecycle of Data Products. 
We have defined Data Products as having 3 stages in their development: Create, Serve and Realize which we will go in to depth on. 

The solution is based on IBM Technology and in the Deployment Architecture we will show the core components of the architecture, highlighting the elements that are critical to build this solution. 

Finally, we will show some client driven use cases that require a Data Product solution lifecycle approach.
